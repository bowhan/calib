# Calib Experiments

These subdirectory include experiment results that were used in Calib's paper publication and development. There are four experiments:

- [Simulation](simulated_tests): Tests run to compare Calib's performance against other tools in terms of accuracy, runtime, and memory use on 3 simulated datasets.
- [Real](real_tests/): Tests run to compare Calib's performance against other tools in terms of accuracy, runtime, and memory use on a real dataset.
- [Scalability](scalability/): Tests run to examine Calib's scalability in terms of memory use and saving on real time with increase in number of threads.
- [Parameter](parameter_tests/): Tests run to select Calib's clustering preconfigured parameter sets.
